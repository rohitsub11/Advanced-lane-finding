##PROJECT ADVANCED LANE FINDING##

##OBJECTIVE##

This project is the udacity advanced lane finding project. The objective of this project is to find the lane lines on the road using advance yet effective camera image processing methodologies.

##STEPS##

1. Calibrate the image and perform image distortion correction on the given chessboard images.
1. Perform color and gradient transformation to create a thresholded binary image.
1. Apply a birds eye view perspective transform to view the lines as parallel lines.
1. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
1. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
1. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
1. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
